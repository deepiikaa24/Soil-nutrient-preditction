                    We at Soil-Ace are on a mission to develop a system that helps farmers understand the 
                    needs of their soil better. This will not only help the farmers get better yield, but will 
                    also allow the soil to be used in an efficient way by including appropriate mineral fertilizers.
                     Our website predicts the mineral content present in the soil based on the dependent variable/factor 
                     provided by the user using the concept of linear regression
